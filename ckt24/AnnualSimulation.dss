! This script is executed after the circuit is defined and the base case is solved

! In this example, a 1-week simulation is performed starting at hour 5208 out of 8760
! This was the peak week in the load shapes defined for the source of this script
! (the default is to start at hour=1 and simulate 8760 hrs)

set casename=ExampleCase
set mode=yearly number= 168    ! one week simulation (omit "number=168' for whole year)

! Set "DemandInterval" to true so that energy quantities recorded by energy meters are recorded for 
! each time step and set "casename" to define a directory under default directory in which all of the 
! demand interval data is recorded.  (NOTE: Setting Demand=true resets all energymeters.)

Set overloadreport=true  ! TURN OVERLOAD REPORT ON
Set voltexcept=true      ! voltage exception report
set demand=true          ! demand interval ON
set DIVerbose=true       ! verbose mode is ON


Set Year=1        ! This statement resets all meters
Set hour=5208     ! start at this hour  (omit to do whole year)
